# Personalities

## Objective

The widget lists some of the most outstanding scientists who made foundational contributions to the development of quantum physics.

## Usage

Use the following HTML to embed the widget into your website:

```html
<iframe src="https://amphiluke.github.io/learn-quantum-mechanics/personalities/" scrolling="no" width="200" height="480" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

### Customization

You may change the time of displaying a single slide using the `interval` parameter in the widget's URL (by default, `interval` is 10 seconds). For example to set the slide rotation time to 5 seconds (5000 ms), use the following URL:
```
https://amphiluke.github.io/learn-quantum-mechanics/personalities/?interval=5000
```
